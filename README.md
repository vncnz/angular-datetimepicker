# angular-datetimepicker

A simple AngularJS directive for a datetimepicker that takes up little space on the screen, and comes with two different styles.

With this user can change date and time values by clicking on +/- buttons or by typing the value in the box.
Moment.js is used for all calculations relating to the date and time.

Style contains two styles, which can be selected -currently- inserting directly in vmDatepicker-template.html class "style1" or "style2".

I hope this can be a useful starting point for datepicker of your projects ;)
